# SpringBootRestCrud
My First SpringBoot project using Rest Web Services, Crud Examples using H2 in memory Database

1)Added few JSP pages in main/webapp folder
2)Created Controller java page to serve and dispatch the requests. This Controller is exposed to front end.
3)Created in memory H2 database to save the data.
4)Saved data can be viewed using Viewname as JSP.
5)The services can be consumed from a browser
6)Insert Employee,Find EmpbyId buttons are added in the main homepage , it redirects to respective pages and can function properly from there.
7)Controller is designed properly to dispatch the requests.
